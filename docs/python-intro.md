## Introduction to Python and JuPyteR

[Python](https://www.python.org/about/) is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1990.  The [Popularity of Programming Language Index](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) (as of June 2020, based on Google search data) lists Python as the most popular of all programming languages. Python is especially widely used for data science applications. 

Python . . .

- is very flexible. Python code is behind websites like YouTube, games like Civilization IV, and of course all sorts of data science projects.
- is extensively used for machine learning; most of the new machine learning implementations are coded in Python.
- is open source and freely available, along with all its [packages](https://pypi.python.org/).


[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents in the **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R** languages.
This course will use JupyterLab, Jupyter's most up-to-date user interface, to teach Python. We provide some introductory materials below. 

Please note that SESYNC provides a cloud platform capable of supporting the software needs for the course, so there is **no computational software for you to install in advance**. However, you are welcome to install any and or all of this software—it is all free and open source—on your own machines.  The list of software is available near the bottom of the [syllabus](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/syllabi/2020/07/21/summer-institute.html).
