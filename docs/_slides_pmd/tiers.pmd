## Tiers of access to online data

- **Scraping:** download static data displayed on a webpage for people

- **REST API:** send HTTP requests for specific datasets

- **API Wrapper:** use a specialized package created by a data provider or user

## Scraping 🙁

If a web browser can read HTML and JavaScript, why can't you (or your "bot")?

===

## RESTful Web Services 😉

An Application Programming Interface (API, as opposed to a GUI) that is compatible with passing data around the web using HTTP, same as your web browser does.

===

## API Wrapper 😂

Major data providers can justify writing a package specific to your language of choice (e.g. Python or R) that facilitates accessing their web service.
