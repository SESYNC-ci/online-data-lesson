## Takeaway

- Web scraping is hard and unreliable, but sometimes there is no other option.
  
- RESTful web services are the most common resource.

- Search [PyPI](https://pypi.org) for the specific API you plan to use.

RESTful web services do not always have great documentation---what
parameters are acceptable or necessary may not be clear. Some may even
be poorly documented on purpose, if the API wasn't designed for public
use. Even if you plan to aquire data using the "raw" web service, try
a search for a relevant package on Python. The package documention
could help.
