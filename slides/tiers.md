## Aquiring Online Data

Data can be available on the web in many different forms. The difficulty you will have aquiring that data for local analysis depends on which of three approaches you need.

===

## Scraping 🙁

If a web browser can read HTML and JavaScript to display a page, why
can't your "bot" read HTML and JavaScript to store the data?

===

## RESTful Web Services 😉

An Application Programming Interface (API, as opposed to a GUI) that
is compatible with passing data around the web using HTTP. The
Hyper-text Transfer Protocol may not be the fastest, but it is
universal (it underpins web browsers, after all).

===

## API Wrapper 😂

Major data providers can justify writing a package, specific to your
language of choice (e.g. Python or R), that facilitates accessing the
data they provide through a web service.
